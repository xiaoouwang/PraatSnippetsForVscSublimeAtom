# Why are you making a slice, what are you studying?
# Depending on that, where will you locate the slice? Remember that the speech spectrum is changing continuously, so the location is critical.
# Do you need a single moment in time, or a long time average (LTA)?
# Do you want to see formant peaks or voice harmonics?

# FFT is easier to set up but is sensitive to fundamental frequency and so is less successful for higher pitched voices.
# LPCÂ  is not sensitive to fundamental frequency but the settings need to be carefully tuned for each speaker.

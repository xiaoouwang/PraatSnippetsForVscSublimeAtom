## How to contribute (add, batch generate your own snippets in any of the forementioned 3 editors)

Go to https://xiaoouwang.github.io/batch_snippets_generator_converter_for_Vsc_Sublime_Atom/, input the praat code in the stated format and click convert.

Then you can create pull request on my github or send me an email to add snippets if you are not familiar with open source contribution.

My email is xiaoouwangfrance@gmail.com

Also check https://github.com/xingyuliuNLP/snippetsConvertMaster for advanced snippets generation (things like $1:suggestion) if you have some basic python experience.

## Why

For so many years praat snippets have been missing from this wonderful world.

**Here they are.**

Install it and the best is yet to come (more snippets, better documentation, better snippets logic and structure).

## Three series for the moment

### those beginning with draw

drPitch = draw Pitch

### those beginning with write

write = writeInfoLine

### Mischancellous

if, while, for, spectro manipulation etc...

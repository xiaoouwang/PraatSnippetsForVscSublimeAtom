#### A1-P0 Calc
select Sound sli# First make a spectrum, then an LTAS (which is the only way to find harmonic heights in Praat for some reason)
noprogress To Spectrum (fft)
Rename... 'soundname$'
noprogress To Ltas (1-to-1)
Rename... 'soundname$'

## Identifies the peak on the spectrum most likely to be F1, that is, the peak
## closest to the LPC F1 value that is within the range of one harmoniselect Ltas 'soundname$'
f1_spec = Get frequency of maximum... 'f1_lpc'-150 'f1_lpc'+150 No# Then get the amplitude
a1_spec = Get value at frequency... 'f1_spec' Nearest
